# HeartRisk360: A Deep Dive into Heart Disease Factors
## ðŸ“Œ Summary of Project
This project is a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of heart disease risk factors using a real-world dataset. It covers data cleaning using Python, database schema design, advanced SQL queries, and deep insights into cardiovascular health. By leveraging Joins, Window Functions, Aggregations, and Statistical Analysis, we uncover the top contributors to heart disease, lifestyle impacts, and predictive risk factors.

**Four key phases** :

- âœ… Data Cleaning (Python): Handling missing values & preparing structured data

- âœ… Database Design (SQL Server): Creating optimized relational tables for efficient querying

- âœ… Advanced SQL Analysis: Extracting deep insights into disease risk using complex queries

- âœ… Data Storytelling (Power BI ): Visualizing findings for better decision-making
